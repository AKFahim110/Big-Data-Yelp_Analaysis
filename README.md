Project Name: Yelp Big Data Analysis

Description:

This repository contains my **Undergraduate Internship Project (partial) ** completed at **Chengdu Suncaper Data Co. Ltd.**
The internship focused on hands-on training in **Big Data Analytics**, **Data Science**, and **Software Development** using cutting-edge technologies and frameworks.
This project utilized Linux OS with Spark, HDFS, HIVE, JDK for data processing. Zeppelin is employed for basic visualization. The project includes a website for real-world visualization using the attached files and programming languages, enabling visualization of the analyzed Yelp dataset and providing recommendations.

Files:
- README.txt (this file)
- data_analysis_script.ipynb
- data_visualization_script.zpln
- website_files/ (folder containing website source files)

Instructions:
1. Install and set up the environment with required dependencies on Linux OS: Spark, HDFS, HIVE, JDK, and Zeppelin(for Visualization).
2. Run data_analysis_script.py to process the Yelp dataset.
3. Execute data_visualization_script.ipynb/zpln files to visualize analyzed data using Zeppelin.
4. Deploy website_files to a web server for visualization and recommendations.


## üß† Overview

The internship provided a comprehensive, practical learning experience in data processing, analysis, and software project management.  
I had the opportunity to work extensively with **Python (for data analysis)**, **Big Data Frameworks (Hadoop, Spark, Hive)**, and **Web Application Development** using frameworks such as **Django** and **Flask**.
